    "This code defines functions for evaluating the quality of translations generated from English to Portuguese. It employs three key metrics: **ROUGE**, **BLEU**, and **METEOR** to assess the similarity between the generated translations and the reference translations in the base dataset. The `teste_model` function utilizes a tokenizer and model to process the input texts, generating translations while collecting the results for evaluation. In contrast, the `teste_model2` function leverages a translation pipeline for the same purpose. Both functions return the computed scores and the generated translations, providing a comprehensive assessment of the translation quality."

A conjectura é comprovada neste artigo para matrizes de densidade. A primeira prova é analítica e usa a lei quântica de grandes números.

      "Introduzimos uma família de anéis de funções simétricas, dependendo de uma sequência infinita de parâmetros. Uma base distinta de tal anel é composta por análogos das funções de Schur. Os coeficientes de estrutura correspondentes são polinômios nos parâmetros que chamamos de polinômios de Littlewood-Richardson. Damos uma regra combinatória para seu cálculo, modificando um resultado anterior de B. Sagan e o autor. A nova regra fornece um polinômio.\n",
      "As possíveis relações de comutação (algébricas) na teoria quântica lagrangiana dos campos livres (escalar, spinor e vetor) são consideradas a partir de um ponto de vista matemático. Como fontes dessas relações são empregadas as equações/relações de Heisenberg para as variáveis dinâmicas e uma condição específica para a unicidade dos operadores das variáveis dinâmicas (com relação a algumas classes de hegrangianos).\n",
      "Os pontos quânticos de correlação epitáxica auto-montados (SAQDs) são de interesse para os dispositivos optoeletrônicos e eletrônicos nanoestruturados, tais como lasers, fotodetectores e lógica de análise de diferentes formas de nanoescala. A ordem espacial e a ordem de tamanho dos SAQDs são importantes para o desenvolvimento de dispositivos utilizáveis. É provável que esses dois tipos de ordem estejam fortemente ligados; portanto, um estudo da ordem espacial também terá fortes implicações para a ordem de ordem espacial.\n",
      "No artigo [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi' c verificou propriedades úteis das funções $K_i(z)$ que generalizam a função fatorial esquerda de Kurepa [Kurepa 1971]. Nesta nota, apresentamos provas simplificadas de dois desses resultados e respondemos à pergunta aberta declarada em [Petojevic 2006]. Finalmente, discutimos a transcendência diferencial do $Kz.\n",
      "O objetivo deste artigo é construir objetos dinâmicos invariantes para um auto-mapa liso (não necessariamente invertível) de um colector compacto. Provamos um resultado que dá vantagem de diferenças nas taxas de expansão de um conjunto de variáveis cohomológicas cohomológicas longas seqências para criar subespaços subvariantes dimensionais únicas de um termo da seqência para os subespaços de corrente diferentes do termo anterior.\n",
      "A oscilação fracionária de Aharonov-Bohm (FABO) de anéis quânticos estreitos com dois elétrons foi estudada e explicada de forma analítica, a evolução do período e amplitudes contra o campo magnético pode ser exatamente descrita. Além disso, a transição dipolo do estado fundamental foi encontrada para ter essencialmente duas frequências, sua diferença aparece como uma oscilação que corresponde à oscilação da corrente persistente exatamente. Um número de equalidades relacionando os parâmetros observáveis e dinâmicos foram encontrados.\n",

      "No presente artigo, propomos um método aparentemente novo para encontrar soluções de alguns tipos de PDEs não lineares em forma fechada. O método é baseado na decomposição de operadores não lineares em sequência de operadores de ordens inferiores. Mostra-se que o processo de decomposição pode ser feito por procedimento(s) iterativo(s), cada passo do qual é reduzido a solução de alguns sistemas PDEs auxiliares para uma variável dependente. Além disso, encontramos, desta forma, a expressão explícita da primeira ordem (número PDE).\n",
      "Tratamos o teorema da injetividade de Koll'ar do ponto de vista analítico (ou geométrico diferencial). Mais precisamente, damos uma condição de curvatura que implica teoremas de injetividade de cohomologia do tipo Koll'ar. Nosso teorema principal é formulado para um coletor compacto de K\"ahler, mas a prova usa o espaço de formas harmônicas em um conjunto aberto de Zariski com uma métrica completa adequada de K\"ahler. Não precisamos de truques de cobertura, dessanularização.\n",
      "Este artigo é uma exposição dos chamados contextos injectivos Morita (em que os morfismos bimodulares de ligação são injectivos) e Morita $alpha$contexts (em que os polímeros de ligação desfrutam de alguma projetividade local no sentido de Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivados por situações em que apenas um vestígio ideal está em ação, ou a compatibilidade entre os morfismos bimodulares não é necessária.\n",
      "Houve um progresso experimental importante no setor de bárions pesados nos últimos anos. Nós estudamos os decaimentos fortes dos bárions S-wave, P-wave, D-wave e radialmente excitados encantados usando o modelo $3P_0$. Depois de comparar o padrão de decaimento calculado e a largura total com os dados disponíveis, discutimos a possível estrutura interna e os números quânticos desses bárions encantados observados recentemente.\n",
      "Os testes de precisão do modelo Kobayashi-Maskawa de violação de CP são discutidos, apontando possíveis assinaturas para outras fontes de violação de CP e para novos operadores que mudam de sabor. O status atual dos testes mais precisos é resumido.\n",
      "O problema da Energia Escura está nos forçando a reexaminar nossos modelos e nossa compreensão da relatividade e do espaço-tempo. Aqui uma nova ideia de Forças Fundamentais é introduzida. Isso nos permite perceber a Teoria Geral da Relatividade e a Equação de Einstein de uma nova pesrpectiva. Além de nos fornecer uma melhor compreensão do espaço e do tempo, será mostrado como isso leva a uma resolução do problema da Energia Escura.\n",
      "Apresentamos uma revisão crítica sobre o estudo de perturbações lineares de tempos de espaço combinados, incluindo problemas de calibre. Analisamos a liberdade introduzida na correspondência perturbada pela presença de simetrias de fundo e revisitamos o caso particular de simetria esférica em n-dimensões. Esta análise inclui configurações com camadas de limite, como modelos de mundo de brana e cosmologias de concha.\n",

      "Mostramos que a função de massa do cluster globular (GCMF) na Via Láctea depende da densidade da meia massa do aglomerado g (rho_h) no sentido de que a massa do volume de negócios r_TO aumenta com rho_h enquanto a largura do GCMF diminui. Argumentamos que esta é a assinatura esperada da erosão lenta de uma função de massa que inicialmente subiu em direção a massas baixas.\n",
      "Discutimos as deformações quânticas das álgebras D4 Lorentz e Poincare. No caso da álgebra Poincare, mostra-se que quase todas as matrizes r clássicas da classificação S. Zakrzewski correspondem às deformações torcidas dos tipos Abeliano e Jordaniano. Uma parte das torções correspondentes às matrizes r da classificação Zakrzewski são dadas de forma explícita.\n",
      "Nós investigamos propriedades dinâmicas de solitons brilhantes com um fundo finito no condensado de Bose-Einstein do spinor F1 (BEC), com base em um modelo de spinor integrável do tipo D, que é equivalente à equação de Schr\"odinger da matriz, com uma não-linealidade de focalização do tipo PS.\n",
      "A integral do caminho sobre as geometrias euclidianas para a matriz de densidade recentemente sugerida do Universo é mostrada para descrever um conjunto microcanônico na cosmologia quântica. Este conjunto corresponde a uma distribuição uniforme (peso um) das variáveis físicas verdadeiras, mas em termos da geometria observável do espaço-tempo é atingido sobre os complexos pontos de sela do em Lorentziano, o conjunto de dimensões da escala cosmológica.\n",
      "Empregamos hidrodinâmica granular para investigar um problema paradigmático de agrupamento de partículas em um gás granular diluído de resfriamento livre. Consideramos movimentos hidrodinâmicos de grande escala, onde a viscosidade e a condução de calor podem ser negligenciadas, e chega-se às equações da dinâmica de gás ideal com um termo adicional que descreve as perdas de energia em massa devido a colisões inelásticas. Empregamos as coordenadas numéricas do tipo de explosão das condições atmosféricas.\n",
      "Discutimos uma propriedade de universalidade de uma teoria de campo de onda covariante no espaço-tempo expandido em torno de fundos de ondas pp. De acordo com esta propriedade, a densidade de lagrangiano de espaço-tempo, todas as funções de campo mais planas também podem ser avaliadas em um conjunto restrito de configurações de campo, chamado de setor universal, que é o mesmo em torno de todas as ondas pp, mesmo fora de casca, com o mesmo espaço transversal e os mesmos perfis para os escalares de fundo.\n",
      "Damos uma análise quantitativa do agrupamento em um modelo estocástico de gás unidimensional. No tempo zero, o gás consiste em partículas idênticas $ $ que são distribuídas aleatoriamente na linha real e têm velocidades iniciais zero. As partículas começam a se mover sob as forças de atração mútua. Quando as partículas colidem, elas se juntam formando uma nova partícula, chamada cluster, cuja massa e velocidade são definidas pelas leis de conservação.\n",

      "Os resultados das características espectrais, energéticas e temporais da radiação na presença do efeito de chama fotônica são apresentados. Opala artificial colocada na placa Cu à temperatura do ponto de ebulição de nitrogênio líquido congelado (77 K) sendo irradiado pelo pulso laser de rubi nanosegundo produz luminescência a longo prazo com uma duração até dez segundos com um espectro finamente estruturado na parte de antistocks do espectro. Em caso de luminescidade luminosa, a mesma luminescência visível apareceu em outras amostras.\n",
      "A modelagem estatística das leis físicas experimentais baseia-se na função de densidade de probabilidade das variáveis medidas. É expressa por dados experimentais através de um estimador de kernel. O kernel é determinado objetivamente pela dispersão de dados durante a calibração da configuração experimental. Uma lei física, que relaciona variáveis medidas, é otimamente extraída de dados experimentais pelo estimador de média condicional. É derivada diretamente do estimador de dados do kernel e corresponde a uma regressão não paramétrica geral.\n",
      "Opções reais para cronogramas de projeto (ROPS) tem três shells recursivos de amostragem / otimização. Um shell de otimização Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) externo otimiza parâmetros de planos estratégicos contendo vários projetos contendo tarefas ordenadas.

      "A contribuição da estrutura para a auto-energia eletrônica em óxidos correlacionados complexos é um assunto fascinante que recentemente estimulou discussões animadas. Expectativas de efeitos de auto-energia elétron-fonônio para materiais mais simples, como Pd e Al, resultaram em vários equívocos em óxidos fortemente correlacionados. Aqui analisamos uma série de argumentos alegando que os fônons não podem ser a origem de certos efeitos de auto-energia vistos em supercondutores de supercondutividade de côr.\n",
      "Apresentamos restrições semi-analíticas na quantidade de matéria escura no aglomerado de galáxias de bala de fusão usando os argumentos clássicos do tempo do Grupo Local.
