    "Our objective in this phase is to reverse the earlier process of generating titles from abstracts; instead, we aim to create detailed abstracts from provided titles. This approach will enable a quick and clear understanding of the research contributions associated with each title. To achieve this, we will employ two models: a baseline model and a specialized pre-trained model tailored for abstract generation. By comparing their performance, we will identify the most effective model for implementation, ensuring that the generated abstracts accurately reflect the essence of the research and enhance the accessibility of scientific findings."

We\\nestimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \\\\approx 2 x 10^33 G\\ncm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed\\nshort-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest\\nthat long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards\\nshorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,\\nwhich have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their\\norbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with\\nspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.\\n\",\n",

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\\n',\n",

In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\\nin the limit of a large array size is considered.

High critical density lines trace regions with similar\\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity.

       " '  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,\\nknown as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a\\nsource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as\\nscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One\\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The\\nlatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.\\n',\n",

Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra\\nX-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms\\npulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution\\nshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of\\n$\\\\dot P = 7.5112(6) \\\\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise\\nand/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\\\\pm5%$\\nmodulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\\\\sim 70%$\\nduty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed\\nemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\\\\Gamma =\\n1.2\\\\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The\\ntotal 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \\\\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\\ns$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.\\n',\n",

       " '  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\\\it\\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\\\it proton-dip\\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\\n$\\\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\\\sim\\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\\\sim\\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\\n',\n",

      "\n",
      "Recent advances in graph decomposition techniques have enabled the efficient analysis of complex networks. However, these methods often rely on heuristics or approximation algorithms, which may not guarantee optimal results. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for sparsity-certifying graph decompositions, which leverages the principles of machine learning and optimization to ensure that the resulting decomposition is both efficient and reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach, dubbed \"SparseNet,\" combines the strengths of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and sparse matrix factorization (SMF) to decompose sparse graphs into a compact and interpretable representation. By incorporating a novel sparsity-promoting loss function, SparseNet is able to identify the most informative features in the graph, even when the input graph is highly sparse.\n",
      "\n",
      "We demonstrate the efficacy of SparseNet on a range of real-world datasets, including social networks, traffic networks, and biological networks. Our results show that SparseNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SparseNet can be easily adapted to handle graphs with varying levels of sparsity, making it an attractive solution for a wide range of applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our work has significant implications for the field of network analysis, as it provides a robust and reliable framework for decomposing sparse graphs. By enabling the efficient analysis of complex networks, SparseNet has the potential to\n"

      "The presence of dark matter in the Earth-Moon system has been a topic of ongoing research and debate. Recent studies have proposed a fluid model of dark matter, which attempts to describe the distribution and behavior of dark matter particles in the system. This model, known as the \"dark matter fluid model,\" posits that dark matter particles interact with each other through a complex network of gravitational and pressure forces, giving rise to the observed gravitational effects on the Earth and Moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling, we investigate the properties and behavior of the dark matter fluid model in the Earth-Moon system. Our results show that the dark matter fluid model can accurately reproduce the observed gravitational effects on the Earth and Moon, including the tidal forces that cause the Moon's eccentricity and the orbital perturbations that affect the Earth's rotation.\n",

      "Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the dark matter fluid model can explain the observed anomalies in the Earth's and Moon's orbits, including the perihelion precession and the apsidal precession. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth-Moon system and the behavior of dark matter in the universe.\n",

      "The Stirling cycle number, a fundamental concept in the theory of single-source automata, is a crucial parameter in characterizing the complexity of such systems. However, the relationship between the number of Stirling cycles and the number of unlabeled cyclic single-source automata (CSAs) is not well understood. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the determinant of the number of Stirling cycles, which is a measure of the complexity of a CSA. We introduce a new framework for counting unlabeled CSAs, which leverages the concept of labeled automata and the use of a combinatorial approach. Our results show that the number of unlabeled CSAs is closely related to the number of unlabeled Stirling cycles, and that the determinant of the number of Stirling cycles can be computed using a combinatorial formula. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to several examples, including the counting of unlabeled CSAs with a specific number of states and transitions.

      "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when separated by large distances. The formation of atomic Cooper pairs is a crucial aspect of superconductivity, where electrons pair up to form a single entity with zero energy. However, the interplay between Cooper pairs and other particles, such as photons, has been a subject of ongoing research. In this study, we investigate the bosonic characterization of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance, focusing on the role of photons in facilitating non-locality. We employ a combination of quantum field theory and condensed matter physics to derive a theoretical framework that describes the behavior of Cooper pairs in the presence of photons. Our results show that photons play a crucial role in enabling non-locality between Cooper pairs, even at low temperatures. We also explore the implications of our findings on the nature of quantum entanglement and the emergence of non-locality in atomic systems.\n"

These exotic mesons are composed of charm quarks, which are not typically found in hadronic matter due to the strong interactions. The lifetime of DCBs, a measure of their decay rates, provides insights into the quark interactions and the strong nuclear force that governs their behavior. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of DCBs, including their properties, production mechanisms, and decay modes. We discuss the theoretical frameworks that predict the existence of DCBs, such as the quark model and the hadronic chiral theory. Theoretical calculations of DCB lifetimes are presented, highlighting the importance of QCD and the strong interactions in shaping their decay rates. Additionally, we examine the experimental searches for DCBs, including the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC, which have provided valuable insights into the properties and properties of these exotic particles.

Using high-resolution spectroscopy and dynamical modeling, we investigate the spectral characteristics of EPX Hydrae during this quiescent phase. Our results reveal a significant decrease in the stellar radius and surface temperature of the white dwarf companion, accompanied by a reduction in the stellar wind velocity and a decrease in the emission line strength of the hydrogen and helium spectral lines. Additionally, we observe a decrease in the radial velocity of the red giant primary, indicating a possible decrease in its orbital velocity and a change in its orbital period. These findings suggest that EPX Hydrae is transitioning from a quiescent state to a more active phase, potentially driven by changes in the binary system's interaction and the evolution of the white dwarf companion.\n"

The D0 decay is characterized by a large hadronic cross-section, which is essential for reconstructing the final state of the D0 system. The hadronic form factor is a crucial component of this process, as it determines the probability of the D0 meson decaying into the observed final state. This measurement provides a precise determination of the hadronic form factor, which can be used to constrain the properties of the D0 meson and the underlying physics of the D0 decay.

      "The synchronized oscillations of molecular machinery, such as enzymatic reactions, are crucial for various cellular processes. In arrays of allosterically regulated enzymes, the interplay between conformational changes and signal transduction can lead to the emergence of complex synchronization waves. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the synchronization of enzymatic reactions in arrays of allosterically regulated enzymes. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, we demonstrate that the conformational changes of individual enzymes can modulate the activity of neighboring enzymes, leading to the synchronization of enzymatic reactions. The results show that the synchronization waves are characterized by a periodic oscillation of enzyme activity, with the amplitude of the oscillations increasing with the number of neighboring enzymes. Furthermore, the analysis of the signal transduction pathways reveals that the allosteric regulation of enzymes plays a key role in the emergence of synchronization waves. The findings of this study provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the synchronization of enzymatic reactions in arrays of allosterically regulated enzymes, and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases characterized by altered cellular rhythms.\n"

      "This abstract introduces a novel class of stochastic Lie group integrators, which are mathematical algorithms used to solve stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of the form $\\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), t) + \\epsilon \\partial_x f(x(t), t)$. The proposed integrators are based on the concept of Lie group theory, which provides a framework for analyzing and solving SDEs in a rigorous and efficient manner. By incorporating stochastic noise into the integrator, we can leverage the inherent uncertainty principle to improve the accuracy and reliability of the numerical solutions. The stochastic Lie group integrators are designed to be scalable and parallelizable, making them suitable for large-scale simulations and real-time applications. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrators, highlighting their potential applications in fields such as finance, chemistry, and materials science.\n"

Numerical simulations using the finite element method (FEM) and the Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) are employed to study the spin dynamics and structural evolution of the system.

      "We present a novel approach to investigating the spectroscopic properties of polarons in strongly correlated systems using the exact diagrammatic Monte Carlo method. Polarons are a class of excitations that arise in strongly correlated systems, such as quantum dimer models and spin-1/2 chains. The exact diagrammatic Monte Carlo method is a powerful tool for calculating the properties of strongly correlated systems, including the spectral density of polarons. In this work, we apply this method to study the spectroscopic properties of polarons in a strongly correlated quantum dimer model. We demonstrate that the exact diagrammatic Monte Carlo method provides a reliable and accurate calculation of the polaron spectral density, which is essential for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of strongly correlated systems. Our results show that the polaron spectral density exhibits a characteristic \"pseudogap\" behavior, which is a hallmark of strongly correlated systems. We also investigate the role of the interaction strength and temperature on the polaron spectral density, and find that the pseudogap behavior is robust against these perturbations. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of strongly correlated systems, and highlight the potential of the exact diagrammatic Monte Carlo method as a powerful tool for studying these systems.\n"

These events are thought to be the final stages of stellar evolution, and their interaction with surrounding environments, including neutrinos, is a crucial aspect of understanding the dynamics of these systems. Neutrinos, with their high-energy flux and ability to interact with matter at very small distances, play a significant role in the physics of SNRs. However, their interactions with non-standard neutrino modes, such as those produced by the supernova explosion, are not well understood. This study aims to investigate the non-standard neutrino interactions with SNRs, with a focus on the effects of neutrino oscillations, neutrino production, and neutrino decays. Our simulations are based on the relativistic Fermi process, which provides a comprehensive description of neutrino production and interactions in SNRs. We find that non-standard neutrino interactions with SNRs can lead to significant changes in the spectral energy distribution, thermalization, and neutrino flux, which in turn impact the overall dynamics of the system.

      "\"Conditional free probability is a fundamental concept in the study of probability theory, where the probability of a random variable is conditioned on its past values. In the context of multilinear function series, we introduce a novel framework that combines the concepts of conditional free probability with amalgamation, a technique for constructing probability measures from conditional expectations. We derive a set of axioms that define the properties of a multilinear function series, including the preservation of conditional expectations and the existence of a unique amalgamated measure. We then analyze the properties of these function series, including their dependence on the initial value and the behavior of their expectations. Our results provide a new perspective on the interplay between conditional free probability and amalgamation, and have implications for the study of probability theory and statistical inference.\"\n",

However, the introduction of noncommutative geometry has revealed that isometries are not unique and can exhibit non-trivial structures in certain cases. This paper explores the concept of quantum group of isometries, which is a mathematical framework that generalizes classical isometries to noncommutative geometries.\n",

However, in noncommutative geometry, the group of isometries can be non-compact and non-abelian, leading to a loss of symmetry. The quantum group of isometries is a mathematical construct that captures this non-trivial structure.\n",

By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to describe the behavior of systems, this framework enables the representation of systems with multiple, conflicting, and context-dependent properties. The integration of fuzzy sets, which are used to quantify uncertainty and imprecision in system behavior, allows for the capture of subtle and nuanced aspects of system dynamics. Furthermore, the application of quantum semantics, which provides a framework for understanding the meaning and interpretation of complex systems, enables the derivation of novel, context-dependent semantics for fuzzy sets. This framework, dubbed \"Quantum-Quantum Fuzzy Semantics\" (QQFS), offers a powerful tool for analyzing and modeling complex systems, and has the potential to revolutionize the field of system theory and complexity science.\n"

      "\n",
      "Lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) are widely used for simulating complex fluid dynamics, including the study of turbulent flows and multiphase flows. However, one of the significant challenges in LBMs is achieving equilibrium, particularly in cases where the system exhibits nonequilibrium behavior. The equilibrium limiters, which are designed to prevent the system from escaping equilibrium, have been a subject of intense research in recent years. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of nonequilibrium entropy limiters (NELs) in LBMs, with a focus on their impact on the numerical stability and accuracy of the simulations. We develop and analyze a novel NEL, which is based on the concept of entropy production and its relationship with the system's energy budget. Our results show that the NEL significantly improves the numerical stability and accuracy of LBMs, particularly in cases where the system exhibits strong nonequilibrium behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NEL can be applied to a wide range of fluid dynamics problems, including turbulent flows and multiphase flows, with minimal impact on the system's energy budget. Our findings have significant implications for the development of more accurate and efficient LBMs, which can be used for a wide range of applications in fields such as aerospace, chemical engineering, and biomedicine.\n"

      "\n",
      "Gyrokinetic phenomena are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, such as the solar wind, stellar interiors, and supernovae explosions. These phenomena arise from the interaction between electromagnetic fields and charged particles, leading to the formation of complex, turbulent structures. In magnetized weakly collisional plasmas, the interplay between magnetic fields, plasma instabilities, and particle transport mechanisms gives rise to a rich landscape of turbulent cascades. This abstract presents a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge on gyrokinetic phenomena in magnetized weakly collisional plasmas, with a focus on kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades. We discuss the underlying physical mechanisms, including the role of magnetic field fluctuations, plasma instabilities, and particle transport processes. We also review the experimental and observational evidence supporting the existence of these phenomena, and discuss the implications for our understanding of astrophysical plasmas. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of turbulent cascades in magnetized weakly collisional plasmas, and highlight the potential applications of this research to the study of astrophysical phenomena.\n"

      "The relationship between entropy and channel capacity is a fundamental concept in information theory, where entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness of a signal. The capacity of a communication system, on the other hand, is a measure of its ability to transmit information efficiently. In this work, we propose a limit relation that establishes a direct connection between entropy and channel capacity per unit cost. By analyzing the trade-off between entropy and channel capacity, we demonstrate that there exists a minimum cost per unit capacity that is optimal for achieving maximum entropy transmission. We derive an expression for this minimum cost, which is derived from the principles of Shannon's source coding theorem and the concept of entropy minimization. Our results show that the minimum cost per unit capacity is inversely proportional to the entropy rate, indicating that increasing entropy rate while maintaining a given capacity leads to a decrease in cost per unit capacity. This limit relation has significant implications for the design of efficient information transmission systems, particularly in the context of wireless communication networks and data storage systems.\n"

Here we give bounds for the size of the alphabet of the suffix array that are not only improved upon by a multiplicative constant but also by a multiplicative constant depending on the size of the alphabet. Previously the best size bound for regular languages of words was exponential in the maximum length, and was shown by Arjuntasiranyi (2011).

We introduce, study, and experimentally demonstrate different classes of topological quantum computation architectures (tQCA). In particular, we show how the presence of certain geometric symmetries of quantum circuits can be used to implement classical computation on topologically protected quantum states of matter. Such classifications do not depend upon explicit or partial knowledge of the ground state of the system. Consequently, we provide an operational procedure that determines when a given tQCA is fully topologically protected and which particular states can be efficiently tested by measurements. Finally, we consider a class of architectures in which a suitable combination of the three-qubit gates is possible and we propose ways to use entangling operations, which implement the required to detect additional two-qubits in a desired-qubits on the remaining-qubits and show a logical gates in two-two gates in these architectures.

The results apply for a particle moving along geodesics and circular or circular orbits in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole. For these cases, we consider a perturbative expansion of the gravitational interaction of the particles with matter and a static magnetic field. We also perform a semiclassical quantization of the system of particles in presence of a cosmological constant, where we find no qualitative difference. Finally, by making use of the Bohm Lagrangian trajectories, we propose a simple derivation and a semiclassical analysis of a general model of a model of quantum theory, where we call quantum gravity with a particle moving in a static magnetic magnetic field and a Schwarzschild black hole.

We demonstrate the ability of a model enzyme to be used as an anti-adiabatic cooling material by combining a Monte Carlo (MC) technique with the theory of transient bistability. The MC method allows efficient calculation of the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis under different temperatures, where the temperature distribution can be determined at the instantaneous steady state. Based on this information, we have developed an algorithm which is able to find all possible intermediate steady states, and obtain the thermodynamic limit of the ATP density for any given temperature. This algorithm has also been applied also to three different enzyme models.

The algorithm starts from the knowledge of the exact time dependence of the probability density function (pdf) of trajectories in the limit, and the moments corresponding to the distribution of times spent in each state of the random walk.

The answer is provided here by a particular class of (uncountably infinite) $W_4$-like subalgebras of Quantum Graphs. These subalgebras provide natural examples for the so-called 'classical' limit of such systems and are described in many more detail (including in this paper also with respect to the so-called 'quantum phase transition'). Since for these classes the $Q-$group structure is not explicitly known, we explore its main properties: (such as the exact classification (a) of nonabelianity of the algebra and its dimension and representation (the number of the smallest dimension that is equivalent from the original group).\n",

      "We propose a scheme that maps one pure two-photon state of a single trapped atom into a pure quantum state as a result of a single step of single spin rotations. While the resulting entanglement between atoms is stable against any change in the beam splitter parameters, even if the atom has certain entanglements with the spins, it becomes degradable due to decoherence induced by rotation in a spontaneous way. We show that our protocol works even when the initial qubit state remains in a pure state for long times, and we outline how to implement a controlled-phase gate without needing the presence of any entanglement. This type of measurement. Our proposal would be useful both for the implementation of entanglement distillation in experimental implementations in atoms based on superconductive matter-wave interferometers and in optical cavities.

      "Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods with time-dependent velocity fields, we show that the corresponding entropy functional depends on the temporal boundary variables and can be written in terms of the solution of an additional set of nonlinear partial differential equations. The resulting entropy functional is differentiable, i.e., the gradient of a suitable functionals of this form vanishes for increasing values of the velocity field. We illustrate our findings for a particular case, where the kinetic equation represents the drift-diffusion equation which models the evolution of microscale particles, namely grains of matter in a Newtonian fluid. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, our results also indicate that the entropy of the linear PDE system can be explicitly recovered from the classical steady-state Navier-Stokes (CS equations for periodic boundary conditions for the same flow conditions.\n",

      "  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas with the density-dependent thermal conductivity are investigated. The resistive effects on the electron temperature are incorporated into the Landau equation for the nonlinear momentum transfer (NMT) between electric charge and magnetic field. It is shown that the NMT equation predicts a negative temperature gradients along the radial direction. As a result, in a strong magnetic field, there is a small increase of the electron temperature ($T_e$). Additionally, the existence of positive temperature gradient (PTG) in this regime is predicted. Also, for weak magnetic field, the LT produces a significant decrease of $\\gamma / T_e$ as a result. In this regime, negative temperature gradients in the distribution and polarization of the particles are generated. For strong magnetic field is suppressed. These results can lead to larger values of the maximum power law which is found for higher frequency in case of the $E<\\gamma_n>m$.

      "  over a gradual slope with bottom friction is investigated for the case where the contact angle at contact is larger then half of the slip length in the horizontal direction at the transition from small to large forces. The contact plane can be obtained by solving a linear equation which describes the evolution of the contact angle as well as the shape and amplitude of the singularities in the linearized displacement field. It is further shown that the effect of the change in contact angle causes a nonlinear dependence of the contact point mobility on both the slope of the contact and the normal derivative of the elasticity tensor at the transition from small to large forces. These observations agree very well both theoretically and quantitatively with data obtained using an atomistic models based on numerical calculations within this model of the linear theory as well as reported by Mocapacam, Pemil and Niterkin (18, Vystovskii (M13b [1(2013a).

Our approach leverages the concept of sparsity-promoting graph neural networks (GP-GNNs) and a novel optimization technique that exploits the sparsity of the network's adjacency matrix. By incorporating sparsity into the optimization process, we achieve a significant reduction in computation time and memory usage, while maintaining excellent performance.

      "The Earth-Moon system has been a paradigmatic example of a complex dynamical system, with intricate interactions between the two bodies. In this study, we propose a novel approach to modeling the evolution of the Earth-Moon system using a dark matter field fluid model. By incorporating the effects of dark matter, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a non-trivial evolution, with a complex interplay between the gravitational, centrifugal, and orbital dynamics. We find that the presence of dark matter leads to a significant increase in the system's total energy, resulting in a more pronounced tidal interaction between the two bodies. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of different dark matter profiles on the system's evolution, and conclude that a more massive dark matter halo would lead to a more rapid increase in the system's total energy. Our results provide a new perspective on the evolution of the Earth-Moon system and highlight the importance of dark matter in understanding the complex dynamics of these celestial bodies.\n"

This phenomenon is attributed to the presence of a non-equilibrium interaction term, which introduces a complex phase shift in the Cooper pair spectral density, leading to a deviation from the standard resonance line.

We also show that GST-Fuzzy can be used to model and analyze a wide range of systems, including quantum systems, social networks, and environmental systems. Ultimately, our work contributes to the development of a more integrated and holistic approach to system theory, one that can better capture the complexities and nuances of real-world systems.\n"

      "The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a widely used numerical technique for simulating complex fluid dynamics, particularly in the context of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and numerical weather prediction (NWP). One of the key challenges in LBM is the development of efficient and accurate algorithms for simulating nonequilibrium states, where the system is far from thermal equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a novel class of entropy limiters, which are mathematical constructs designed to stabilize the LBM in the limit of high entropy. We demonstrate that these limiters can significantly improve the accuracy and stability of LBM simulations, particularly in the context of nonequilibrium flows. Specifically, we show that the proposed limiters can reduce the dissipation rate of the LBM, leading to improved resolution and accuracy in simulations of complex nonequilibrium systems. Our results highlight the importance of developing more robust and efficient algorithms for simulating nonequilibrium states in LBM, and demonstrate the potential of entropy limiters as a key component of such algorithms.\n"

      "The dynamics of magnetized weakly collisional plasmas exhibit complex kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades, leading to the formation of novel astrophysical phenomena. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of gyrokinetic effects in these systems, including the propagation of magnetic waves, the generation of turbulence, and the role of kinetic and fluid instabilities. We discuss the underlying mechanisms, including the effects of magnetic field instabilities, Alfvén waves, and plasma turbulence, and provide a framework for understanding the consequences of these phenomena on the behavior of plasmas in astrophysical environments, such as neutron stars and stellar interiors. Our analysis highlights the importance of accounting for gyrokinetic effects in the simulation of plasmas in these systems, and we propose a new paradigm for understanding the interplay between kinetic and fluid turbulence in magnetized weakly collisional plasmas.\n"

      "Abstract: We investigate the evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows over a gradual slope with bottom friction. The dynamics of these flows are characterized by a balance between the restoring forces associated with the solitary waves and the dissipative forces due to the bottom friction. Our analysis reveals that the evolution of these flows is highly sensitive to the initial conditions, including the slope angle and the amplitude of the solitary waves. Specifically, we show that the formation and propagation of undular bores, which are periodic oscillations in the flow, can be significantly influenced by the bottom friction, leading to a complex interplay between the wave dynamics and the frictional forces. Our results have implications for the study of nonlinear wave propagation in various fluid dynamics applications, including oceanography and geophysics.\n"

By analyzing the interplay between entropy, channel capacity, and cost, we derive a limit relation that describes the optimal trade-off between these competing factors. This limit relation has significant implications for the design of efficient information processing and communication systems, particularly in the context of noisy channels and limited resources. Our analysis provides a framework for understanding the fundamental limits of information processing and communication, and offers insights into the design of more efficient and effective systems.\n"

      "The detection of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources is a challenging task due to the complex interplay between various acoustic and non-acoustic factors. In this paper, we propose a novel method to locate these sources, leveraging the synergistic effects of machine learning and geophysical data. We introduce a deep learning framework, Acoustic Source Localization (ASL), which jointly integrates acoustic emission data with geophysical models to identify simultaneous active sources. The ASL approach is based on the concept of acoustic source separation, which utilizes the spatial and temporal characteristics of the acoustic signals to disambiguate overlapping sources. By combining ASL with a machine learning-based approach, we demonstrate the efficacy of this method in locating simultaneously active acoustic emission sources in various geological settings.\n",

      "We propose an innovative approach to infer properties of white dwarf binary systems using the first round of the Mock LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission data. The LISA mission aims to detect gravitational waves from merging compact objects, including white dwarfs. By leveraging the vast amount of data generated by the LISA mission, we will investigate the properties of white dwarf binary systems, such as their masses, radii, and orbital periods. Our method, dubbed \"LISA White Dwarf Binary\" (LWDB), will employ machine learning algorithms to analyze the LISA data, identifying patterns and correlations that are indicative of white dwarf binary systems. We will also explore the potential for using the LISA data to constrain models of stellar evolution and the formation of white dwarfs. The results of this analysis will provide valuable insights into the properties of white dwarf binary systems, shedding light on their role in the formation and evolution of compact objects in the universe.\n"

Our algorithm leverages the concept of \"polytope decomposition\" to systematically classify the polytopes based on their underlying geometry. By combining geometric insights with combinatorial techniques, we demonstrate that the algorithm can efficiently identify and classify smooth Fano polytopes, including those with complex geometries and singularities. We also explore the application of our algorithm to the study of polytopes in higher dimensions and its potential connections to other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and combinatorial geometry.\n",

By analyzing the time and spatial distribution of acoustic emissions, we identify the source of the emissions as the neutron star, even in the presence of a significant number of simultaneously active sources.

    "The results show that few-shot learning provides an advantage in terms of accuracy and relevance (Rouge and BLEU scores). Although the difference is marginal, the model produces more detailed abstracts that closely align with the style of real scientific abstracts. While perplexity increases slightly, the impact is minimal and is outweighed by the overall gain in text quality.\n",
